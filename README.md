# repo_template
This section should contain an overview of your repository.
For example, this is a general-purpose template repository for 
all projects in Ma Lab.

## Get Started
To use this template for your own project, fork this repo by following
[this guide for how to Fork a Repository](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo). 
Make sure you give your repository a descriptive name separated by 
underscores instead of spaces, such as `my_project_name`.

# Directory
Every repository should have a directory for files
describing the structure of the repository and a high-level
overview of the contents
